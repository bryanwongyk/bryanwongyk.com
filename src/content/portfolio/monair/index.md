<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This project is being built for my final year project and is still in progress. It is currently hosted in a private shared GitLab repository.

I have the role of <b>Developer</b> and <b>System Architect</b>.

</p>
<br>
<p>
So far, I have been able to learn:

<ul>
<li>How to set up a project with all the required configurations (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, package.json commands) for the team</li>
<li>How to implement react-map-gl/MapBox </li>
<li>What react-testing-library is and how it may be used </li>
</ul>

</p>
<br>
<p>
As a System Architect I have contributed to the following:

<ul>
<li>Review of Alternative Software document where I compared our proposed solution against existing solutions available</li>
<li>Potential Solution Architecture document where I selected libraries/frameworks/packages used for the project, selected the overall system architecture, compared these selections against alternatives, and provided a risk analysis for each selection</li>
<li>Creation of a domain analysis</li>
<li>Liaison with the client and specification of requirements</li>
<li>Breaking down requirements into user stories and prioritising them</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Since most of the front-end team for the project have little experience with most of the technologies used (e.g. React, TypeScript, modern JavaScript syntax), I have also played a guiding role on teaching my peers.
