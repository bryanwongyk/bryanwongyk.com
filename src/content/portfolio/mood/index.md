<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This project was built for HackMelbourne's Hackiethon 2021, where participants had to build a web application addressing the issues of Work From Home (WFH) over the Easter weekend. My team's project landed itself as a finalist against 70+ other teams, and won the 'Most Outstanding Design' award.

This was our first hackathon where I was one out of two developers in the team with a team size of four. I pitched the original concept to the team, led the development of the web application, and guided the design process.

mood. offers a solution to the problems of improving the health and well-being of those who study or work from home. Features include guided stretch routines and meditation, giving users a well-deserved break from their hectic work schedules. We provide a light-hearted, humorous twist to wellness, through relatable themes of the struggles of the typical “work-at-home” employee in an all-in-one mind hub.
