<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This project initially began as a way for me to practice HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript after completing my first two web development online courses. I returned to complete it about a year later implementing new technologies I had learned.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
The entire website was approached with a mobile-first approach to enable a smooth responsive design.

I drew upon design inspiration from other websites I had visited and attempted to re-implement them entirely by myself. Some of these included:

<ul>
<li>A hero slideshow with clickable tabs to switch images from <a href="https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en">Lamborghini</a></li>
<li>A mobile menu that wipes downwards from <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com.au/">Deloitte Digital</a></li>
<li>A hover effect on navigation items from <a href="https://alphaleteathletics.com/">Alphalete</a></li>
<li>An alternating image and text grid layout from <a href="https://au.gymshark.com/pages/about-us">GymShark</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Technology list</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eleventy (with EJS templating)</li>
<li>SCSS</li>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>Webpack</li>
<li>Prettier</li>
<li>Cloudinary</li>
</ul>
