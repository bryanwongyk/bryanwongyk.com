> “I know that I know nothing” - Socrates

I recently stumbled upon a blog post by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) titled [‘Things I Don’t Know as of 2018’](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/). Dan is a software engineer at Facebook known for co-creating the Redux library and working on the React team. I started following him a while ago because I was interested in seeing what he had to say as a prominent front-end developer. In his post, Dan lists the different programming topics he believed he didn’t know much about including algorithms, back-end programming, and deployment. Given Dan's track record, I had assumed that he would be a whiz at everything, so reading his post shocked and reassured me at the same time. If you're the kind of person who likes to dangerously hold themselves to high expectations, my reaction may resonate with you as well.

When I first started my Software Engineering degree four years ago, I was clueless. I learned enough to score great grades in classes, but I sometimes felt a disconnect between the theory that I was learning and the practical skills I thought I needed in the real world. This was immediately apparent to me when I struggled to contribute to group projects that required building actual applications, when most of my experience so far was spent on writing bits of Python code to solve homework problems.

Fast forward to the present day in my final year, I still feel this feeling of ‘not knowing enough’ regularly.

One of my largest pain-points lately has been revisiting data structures and algorithms. This is usually recognised as one of the core topics you need to excel at if you want to be considered a 'great' software engineer. I did well at it in class several years ago, but since then I’ve struggled to get a lot of the concepts to stick. So when I read that Dan (in 2018) probably knew as many sorting algorithm implementations as I did, it helped me feel less stupid.

What I have learned over my time studying is that software engineering is so vast and deep, you can survive not knowing everything. In fact, it's probably healthier if you don't beat yourself up over not knowing everything.

From the end of my third year onwards, I spent _lots_ of time outside of my studies completing online courses and creating side projects to tackle my weakness of not knowing how to build ‘real’ applications. Since a majority of what I learned was focused on front-end development, I realised that there were still many areas of programming I wasn't exposed to. Now in my final year, I’ve been kicking myself over my lack of proficiency at topics like algorithms or systems design.

The learning journey has been an iterative process of chopping a head off the Hydra and finding two new heads growing back each time.

So if you’re ever feeling defeated about programming, just know that you aren't alone. I was there, and I still feel like I’m there a lot of the times too. As Dan's post illustrates, lots of other people will have their own knowledge gaps as well that may surprise you. As long as you stay on a sustainable trajectory of learning, all you need are those few breakthrough moments to make up for it.
