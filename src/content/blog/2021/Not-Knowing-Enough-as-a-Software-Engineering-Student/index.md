> “I know that I know nothing” - Socrates

I recently stumbled upon a blog post by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) titled [‘Things I Don’t Know as of 2018’](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/). Dan is a software engineer at Facebook known for co-creating the Redux library and working on the React team. I started following him a while ago because I was interested in seeing what he had to say as a prominent front-end developer. In his post, Dan lists a collection of different programming topics he believed he didn’t know much about including algorithms, back-end programming, and deployment. Needless to say, when I read the post I was shocked and relieved at the same time. It was a reminder for myself to relax and to reflect realistically upon my own expectations for what I wanted to achieve.

When I first started my Software Engineering degree four years ago, I was clueless. I learned enough to score great grades in classes, but it felt like there was some disconnect between what was taught in class and the skills I needed in the real world. This was immediately apparent to me when I struggled to contribute to group projects that required building actual applications, when most of my experience so far was spent on writing bits of Python code to solve homework problems.

Fast forward to present day in my final year, I still feel this feeling of ‘not knowing enough’ frequently. It’s created a sense of urgency that’s been like trying to sprint from a fire as quickly as I can, except I’ve found myself burned out more times than I’d like.

One of my largest pain-points this year has been revisiting data structures and algorithms. This is usually recognised as one of the core topics you need to excel at if you want to be considered a ‘great’ software engineer. I did well at it in class several years ago, but since then I’ve frequently struggled to get a lot of the concepts to stick. So when I read that I probably knew as many sorting algorithm implementations as Dan, a well-known software engineer, it honestly did help me feel less like an idiot.

What I have learned over my time studying is that the field of software engineering is so vast and deep, you can survive not knowing everything. From the end of my third year, I spent _lots_ of time outside my studies completing online courses and creating side projects to tackle my weakness of not knowing how to build ‘real’ applications. Since a majority of it was focused on front-end development, I realised that there were still many areas of programming I didn’t know much about including back-end development or DevOps. Now that I’m in my final year, I’m still kicking myself for not being proficient at other topics I feel that I _should_ ‘know’ well to become great, like algorithms or systems design. The journey has been an iterative process of chopping a head off the Hydra and finding two new heads growing back each time. Yet, if I was to be realistic with myself, I would probably need a lot more time and personal commitment to continue developing these skills.

So, if you’re ever feeling defeated about programming, just know that it’s ok. I was there, and I still feel like I’m there a lot of the time. As long as you slow it down to a sustainable pace, and stay on this trajectory of giving it a crack a hundred times, all you need is that one breakthrough moment to make up for it. Another tip is to not waste too much time looking at LinkedIn because you’ll end up comparing yourself to other people for no good reason.

It’s ok to not know everything.
