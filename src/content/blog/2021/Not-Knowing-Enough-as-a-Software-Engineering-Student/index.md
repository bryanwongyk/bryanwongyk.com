> “I know that I know nothing” - Socrates

I recently stumbled upon a blog post by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) titled [‘Things I Don’t Know as of 2018’](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/). Dan is a software engineer at Facebook known for co-creating the Redux library and working on the React team. In his post, Dan lists the different programming topics he believed he didn’t know much about including algorithms, back-end programming, and deployment. My first reaction was shock. Given Dan's track record, I assumed that he would have been a whiz at everything. My second reaction was a huge sense of relief. I'm not as dumb as I thought I was.

When I first started my Software Engineering degree four years ago, I was clueless. I learned enough to score great grades in class, but I sometimes felt a disconnect between the theory that I was learning and the practical skills I thought I needed in the real world. I realised this quickly when I struggled to contribute to group projects that required building actual applications, when I had become acclimated to writing bits of contained Python code to solve homework problems.

Now that I'm in my final year, I still feel this feeling of ‘not knowing enough’ regularly. One of my largest pain-points lately was revisiting data structures and algorithms. I did well at it in class several years ago, but I’ve struggled to get a lot of the concepts to stick since then. Its often expected to be core knowledge for "excellent" software engineers, so it was easy for me to fall into the trap of thinking "maybe I'm just not cut out for this".

The learning journey has been like an iterative process of chopping a head off the Hydra and finding two new heads growing back each time.

It's been an important lesson for me to relax. Continuous learning is key, but only when it's on a sustainable trajectory. As long as your trajectory is pointing upwards, you'll get to where you want to be.
