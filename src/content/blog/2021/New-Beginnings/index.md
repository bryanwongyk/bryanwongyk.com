> "You can do everything you want in life, but you can't do them at the same time" - Tim Ferris

I'll keep this short.

I always knew that I wanted to construct my online presence as a creative outlet and to 'show my work'/'build in public'.

But I never knew what I should speak about and on which platforms - I feel like I have too many different passions!

This blog space was originally intended to be a free-for-all to broadcast my thoughts on anything and everything. However, this diluted my vision of what I actually wanted to do.

My focus was spread too thinly across many different things.

During the past few weeks, I sought out answers online. This made me realise that <b>focus</b> and having an <b>end goal</b> is the key for both accelerating my personal growth, and for creating compelling content.

So I decided that this blog will be used purely for documenting my technical growth as a software engineer. I won't be holding myself to any sort of schedule for this, nor will I always post anything extensive.

For everything else I'm passionate about, I'm pondering upon using YouTube as a creative outlet. This means covering topics like lifestyle, thoughts on philosophy, and business. The great thing about video is that it would allow me to combine my love for film-making, design, and music.

Anyway, that's for later in the future.

Welcome to the new blog.
