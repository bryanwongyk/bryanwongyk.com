I wanted to share the podcasts that I've loved listening to lately whether I'm in the car, in the gym, or washing dishes.

I've discovered all of these by accident, so if anyone has any other recommendations please shoot me a message!

# 1. Indie Hackers

**Indie Hackers** is a podcast created and hosted by [Courtland Allen](https://twitter.com/csallen). It is also one of the [largest internet communities for entrepreneurs](https://www.indiehackers.com/). An 'indie hacker' is someone who sets out to make money independently, whether it is through a start-up, side hustle, or business.

Each episode, Courtland interviews an indie hacker and they are absolute goldmines of information and inspiration.

## Why I like it

-   **Transparent interviews** where indie hackers divulge information such as how much revenue they are making.
-   An **active online community** with people sharing the progress on their own endeavours and discussing their ideas.
-   The **range of people interviewed**. Indie hackers are not all start-up founders trying to create the next big thing, and so there is a lot of inspiration around people simply trying to create supplementary streams of income in really smart ways.

# 2. My First Million

**My First Million** is a podcast co-hosted by [Shaan Puri](https://www.shaanpuri.com/) and [Sam Parr](https://twitter.com/theSamParr) where they brainstorm and discuss business ideas or trends. Sometimes, they also do this with guests who are successful in their own fields, so there's definitely something to be learned! I found out about them through a great episode on Indie Hackers.

## Why I like it

-   **Interesting discussions** based on a wide range of actual businesses or trends.
-   **Great guests**. Some of the ones I've listened to included Scott Belsky (a co-creator of Behance, a social platform for creators) and Mike Maples (a co-founder of Floodgate, a venture capital firm).
-   Sometimes **includes other nuggets of information** like book recommendations or general work tips.

# 3. Today, Explained

This one is less like my first two recommendations. **Today, Explained** is a podcast by [Vox](https://www.vox.com/) where they talk about contemporary news topics in less than 30 minutes.

## Why I like it

-   It's **short, concise, and entertaining**.
-   The use of audio (e.g. interviews, audio snippets, music) makes it feel like a **documentary in podcast form**.
-   It helps me feel like I'm actually becoming **more educated about the world**.
