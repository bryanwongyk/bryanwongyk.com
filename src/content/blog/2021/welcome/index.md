Hi everyone! Welcome to my personal website.

This is a project I hope I can continuously build upon with new features, sections, and posts whenever I can.

As of the time of writing, I am still new to using GatsbyJS (and all it's companions like GraphQL). So, after I manage to publish the barebones of the Home, Blog, and Projects pages, my main focus will be on refactoring and understanding all the intricacies of this static site generator.

There are still a lot of commitments on my plate at the moment such as:

-   University work (which will soon include the commencement of my final year-long Software Engineering project)
-   Personal commitments
-   Self-study (I'm still trying to find the time and prioritise between continuing to learn React, TypeScript, and a whole heap of other topics. To see more, visit my study GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/bryanwyk/learning-front-end).)

So, I'll try my best. Otherwise, thanks for visiting!
