There is an enormous amount of opportunity to do anything we want for money, but there's not enough time to do everything.

Removing luck out of the equation, a common element in most success stories is the sheer amount of work that's been done over massively extended periods of time.

A great way to self-assess whether we actually enjoy something enough to put in those hard yards (and be happier along the journey), or whether we're just fantasizing about the idea of success is to ask ourselves, **"Is this something I can commit to for 5 or 10 years?"**.
